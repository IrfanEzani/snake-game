## Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Snake game. In this game, the player controls a snake to eat fruits that appear randomly on the screen. Each fruit eaten makes the snake longer, and the game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or into itself.

## Files
- `index.html`: Entry point for the game.
- `app.js`: Main application logic.
- `snake.js`: Handles the snake's logic.
- `fruit.js`: Manages fruit behavior and appearance.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the game's appearance.

## Run the Game
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.
3. Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
